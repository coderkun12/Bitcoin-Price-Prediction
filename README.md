# Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This project explores various machine learning models to predict Bitcoin prices. The primary goal is to evaluate which model performs best for this specific task. We investigate and compare the performance of:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Lasso Regression
Elastic Net
RidgeCV
Project Goal
The main objective of this project is to identify the most effective machine learning model for accurate Bitcoin price prediction.

## Key Findings
Among the models evaluated, Lasso Regression demonstrated the best performance for Bitcoin price prediction. It was observed that Lasso Regression consistently predicted Bitcoin values within a range of $188 difference from the actual (original) prices.

## Models Explored
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems.
SVM (Support Vector Machine): A supervised learning model used for classification and regression tasks.
Lasso Regression: A linear model that estimates sparse coefficients.
Elastic Net: A regularized linear regression model that combines the penalties of Lasso and Ridge regression.
RidgeCV: Ridge regression with built-in cross-validation.
